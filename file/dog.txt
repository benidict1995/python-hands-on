The dog ran across the yard as another dog barked at a third dog near the doghouse. Every dog seemed to have a different plan: one dog chased a ball while another dog sniffed the bushes, and yet another dog slept in the sun. The dog owners watched as their dogs interacted, noting how each dog had its own personality. Even the smallest dog managed to join the play, while the oldest dog stayed calm, watching all the other dogs. By the end of the afternoon, every dog was tired but happy, and the dogs curled up together, proving that dogs, no matter their size or age, always find a way to enjoy being dogs.
